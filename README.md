# Simple3DVis - Single Page Application
Custom SPA which can be used as simple 3D engine (using THREE.js)
- I used THREE.js library just to find out, how much easier would it be to use high-level library (like Three.js...) 
  instead of using low-level OpenGL library, which I used in my bachelor's thesis.
- Main purposes of this project were to excersise advanced CSS3, advanced HTML5 & advanced JS ES6+ using some complex 3rd-party library 
  (in this case mainly Three.js)
  
- the application can display multiple 3D objects (complex scene), including their textures
- simple spotlight was implemented
- it can also display 3D models and textures loaded directly from DragAndDrop form (uploading to server directory is not necessary)
